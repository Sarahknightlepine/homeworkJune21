User Story
As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

Acceptance Criteria
When I click the button to generate a password, I should be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
When prompted for password criteria, I can select which criteria to include in the password.
When prompted for the length of the password, I can choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
When asked for character types to include in the password, I can confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
When I answer each prompt, my input should be validated, and at least one character type should be selected.
When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
When the password is generated, it is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
